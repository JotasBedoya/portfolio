### About me

I am a Systems Engineer and Data Analyst with over 4 years of experience transforming data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. I specialize in data analysis, business intelligence, and process optimization, combining analytical thinking with efficient technical solutions.

I have worked with technologies such as Python, SQL, Power BI, DAX, Snowflake, AWS, and Excel, designing dashboards, automating reports, and improving data workflows for both technical and non-technical stakeholders, including leadership teams.

My professional journey has allowed me to evolve from operational and quality assurance roles into more strategic positions such as Reporting Analyst and Product Data Analyst, working closely with managers and directors to ensure data integrity and deliver meaningful business impact.

I enjoy working end-to-end, from problem understanding and requirements definition to technical implementation and final delivery. I have a continuous learning mindset and stay up to date with Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software development.
